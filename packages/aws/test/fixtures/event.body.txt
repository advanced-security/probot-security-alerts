If the function is not documented as being potentially unsafe, then a client may inadvertently use inputs containing unsafe HTML fragments, and thereby leave the client vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.\n\n\n## Recommendation\nDocument all library functions that can lead to cross-site scripting attacks, and guard against unsafe inputs where dynamic HTML construction is not intended.\n\n\n## Example\nThe following example has a library function that renders a boldface name by writing to the `innerHTML` property of an element.\n\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = function showBoldName(name) {\n  document.getElementById('name').innerHTML = \"<b>\" + name + \"</b>\";\n}\n\n```\nThis library function, however, does not escape unsafe HTML, and a client that calls the function with user-supplied input may be vulnerable to cross-site scripting attacks.\n\nThe library could either document that this function should not be used with unsafe inputs, or use safe APIs such as `innerText`.\n\n\n```javascript\nmodule.exports = function showBoldName(name) {\n  const bold = document.createElement('b');\n  bold.innerText = name;\n  document.getElementById('name').appendChild(bold);\n}\n\n```\nAlternatively, a HTML sanitizer can be used to remove unsafe content.\n\n\n```javascript\n\nconst striptags = require('striptags');\nmodule.exports = function showBoldName(name) {\n  document.getElementById('name').innerHTML = \"<b>\" + striptags(name) + \"</b>\";\n}\n\n```\n\n## References\n* OWASP: [DOM
